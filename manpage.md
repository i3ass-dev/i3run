DESCRIPTION
-----------
`i3run` let's you use one command for multiple
functions related to the same window identified by
a given criteria.  `i3run` will take different
action depending on the state of the searched
window:  

| **target window state**          | **action**
|:---------------------------------|:------------
| Active and not handled by i3fyra | hide
| Active and handled by i3fyra     | hide container, if not `-g` is set
| Handled by i3fyra and hidden     | show container, activate
| Not handled by i3fyra and hidden | show window, activate
| Not on current workspace         | goto workspace or show if `-s` is set
| Not found                        | execute command (`-e`)



Hidden in this context,  means that window is on
the scratchpad. Show in this context means,  move
window to current workspace.  


`-e` is optional, if no *COMMAND* is passed and no window is found,  nothing happens.  It is important that `-e` *COMMAND* is **the last of the options**.  It is also important that *COMMAND* **will spawn a window matching the criteria**,  otherwise the script will get stuck in a loop waiting for the window to appear. (*it will stop waiting for the window to appear after 10 seconds*)


OPTIONS
-------

`--instance`|`-i` INSTANCE  
Search for windows with the given INSTANCE

`--summon`|`-s`  
Instead of switching workspace, summon window to

`--nohide`|`-g`  
Don't hide window/container if it's active.

`--mouse`|`-m`  
The window will be placed on the location of the
mouse cursor when it is created or shown. (*needs
`xdotool`*)  

`--rename`|`-x` OLD_NAME  
If the search criteria is `-i` (instance), the
window with instance: *OLDNAME* will get a n new
instance name matching the criteria when it is
created (*needs `xdotool`*).  

```shell
i3run --instance budswin --rename sublime_main -command subl

# when the command above is executed:
# a window with the instance name: "budswin" will be searched for.
# if no window is found the command: "subl" will get executed,
# and when a window with the instance name: "sublime_main" is found,
# the instance name of that window will get renamed to: "budswin"
```
