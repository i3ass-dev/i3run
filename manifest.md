# long_description

`i3run` let's you use one command for multiple functions related to the same window identified by a given criteria. 
`i3run` will take different action depending on the state of the searched window:  

| **target window state**          | **action**
|:---------------------------------|:------------
| Active and not handled by i3fyra | hide
| Active and handled by i3fyra     | hide container, if not `-g` is set
| Handled by i3fyra and hidden     | show container, activate
| Not handled by i3fyra and hidden | show window, activate
| Not on current workspace         | goto workspace or show if `-s` is set
| Not found                        | execute command (`-e`)


Hidden in this context, 
means that window is on the scratchpad.
Show in this context means, 
move window to current workspace.  


`-e` is optional, if no *COMMAND* is passed and no window is found, 
nothing happens. 
It is important that `-e` *COMMAND* is **the last of the options**. 
It is also important that *COMMAND* **will spawn a window matching the criteria**, 
otherwise the script will get stuck in a loop waiting for the window to appear.
(*it will stop waiting for the window to appear after 10 seconds*)
